# oracle-to-snowflake
Toolset to migrate from Oracle to Snowflake on Amazon w/S3

ToDo:
1. Write generic Py Script to export from an Oracle table.
2. Write script to use Oracle export tool which I think is called datapump or something.
3. Write scripts to emulate from one Oracle schema into Snowflake. Recreate tables
     into a specified schema. Include ability to load those tables.
